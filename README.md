# CodeQueryAI
A simple AI for coding queries which made using Javascript and CHATGPT's code-cushman AI model.
In any case, if the AI is not responding, visit https://codequery.onrender.com/ to check if the server is responding. If it is, upon opening the URL a test message is expected.

Note: The response to the requests may have some delay due to heavy traffic on OpenAI servers. Usually the first response has a slight delay.
